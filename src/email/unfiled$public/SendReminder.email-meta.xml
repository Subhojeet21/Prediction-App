    <subject>Reminder: Prediction for ICC World Cup</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!User.FirstName} ,

It seems you are yet to predict the &quot;&quot;Winner and the &quot;Man of the Match&quot; for today&apos;s match in the app.
Its a gentle reminder for you so that you do not miss out on prediction for today&apos;s scheduled match/matches. It will only take few minutes to predict.
Kindly complete your prediction before 3 pm for the first match of the day and before 6 pm for the second match.
Play along and earn points to maintain/improve you position in Points table. :)

Thanks,
App Admin</textOnly>
